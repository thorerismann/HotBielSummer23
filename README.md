# HotBielSummer23

Welcome to the repository for the HotBielSummer23 project. This project aims to analyze and visualize urban temperature data from Biel in 2023.

- All of the charts and results included in the analysis can be obtained by cloning/downloading this repository and running main.py
- Need to request the data though - still figuring out long term storage. **Issue a request through GitHub please**
- The app is available through streamlit [here](ttps://hotbielsummer23.streamlit.app)
- For any support reach out **through github** and I will be happy to support
- Running the app locally will require installing the second environment file located in the app/ directory.

Thanks for visiting !
